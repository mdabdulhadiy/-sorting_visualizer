# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Overview : 

This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that helps in understanding how different sorting algorithms work by visually representing each step. The visualizer supports Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort. You can generate an array of random numbers and observe how each sorting algorithm operates on the array in real-time.


## Features

- Generate Array: Randomly generates an array of integers to be sorted.
- Selection Sort: Visualize the process of finding the minimum element and swapping it to the correct position.
- Bubble Sort: Watch how adjacent elements are compared and swapped to sort the array.
- Insertion Sort: See how elements are shifted to their correct position in a sorted part of the array.
# Color Indicators:
- Blue: Indicates the current element under consideration.
- Red: Highlights the elements being compared or swapped.
- Light Green: Marks the element that has been correctly placed.
- Black: Marks sorted parts of the array.


## Usage


- Generate Array: Click on the "Generate" button to create a random array.
- Select a Sorting Algorithm:
- Click on "Selection Sort" to observe the selection sort algorithm.
- Click on "Bubble Sort" to visualize the bubble sort algorithm.
- Click on "Insertion Sort" to see the insertion sort algorithm in action.
- Disable/Enable Buttons: The buttons will be disabled while a sorting algorithm is running and re-enabled after the sorting is complete.



## Project Structure
- index.html: Contains the basic structure of the visualizer.
- styles.css: Styles the visualizer and the bars.
- script.js: Contains the logic for generating the array, sorting algorithms, and animations.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
## Future Enhancements
- Add more sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- Include a slider to adjust the speed of the animation.
- Implement additional color-coding to represent different stages of sorting.
- Optimize performance for larger arrays.
